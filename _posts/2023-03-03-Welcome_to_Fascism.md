Last night, I was scrolling Twitter and saw that Jason Brodeur (R-Lake Mary) had filed [SB 1316](https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2023/1316) which would require bloggers who write about goverment officials to register with the state!

This is not the first, or maybe not even the most, Fascist thing this "freedom" loving government in Florida has done, but it was what drove me to secure this domain and start a f**king, unregistered, blog!

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">CPAC darling Florida Senator Jason Brodeur, <a href="https://twitter.com/jasonbrodeur?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@jasonbrodeur</a>, wants bloggers who write about Florida politicians to register with the state or face fines.<br><br>Today&#39;s GOP is indistinguishable from Communist Russia.<br><br>Hey, Jason, I was paid 10K to post this ðŸ‘‰ COME AT ME!<br><br>RT <a href="https://t.co/QcFpJsiFoh">pic.twitter.com/QcFpJsiFoh</a></p>&mdash; StandForBetter.org (@StandForBetter) <a href="https://twitter.com/StandForBetter/status/1631760362579329024?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 3, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

Ironically, the GOP claim to be the party of small government...but they want government to regulate just about everything so that it suites them...
