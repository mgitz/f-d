The Sun Sentinel Editorial Board called out DeSantis as "hideously hypocritical" for his "Freedom Lives Here" slogan: [Our basic freedoms are under constant attack in ‘free’ Florida](https://www.sun-sentinel.com/opinion/editorials/fl-op-edit-legislation-restricting-freedom-florida-20230311-jlvcg2i5dnds3azdcwx4ltfnmu-story.html)

> They are subverting everything in the First Amendment except religion...

> A woman’s freedom of choice will end at six weeks, before many know they are pregnant. Academic freedom is to be banished from universities so they can become echo chambers of right-wing politics, as with New College in Sarasota. Teachers face more restrictions on what they can say about sexual topics, and doctors will be criminals for providing gender-affirming care such as puberty blockers to transgender children.

In case people think it is an exaggeration that books are being removed from schools, I can tell you, there is no exaggeration! My son is in 11th grade at a school in Florida; every teacher covered their bookshelves with butcher paper until the books can be reviewed by the *one* media specialist. Teachers are threatened with jail for allowing students access to books that have not been approved. And the list of approved books is exceedingly short! 

> There are too many bad bills to describe them all here. 

> If the Legislature passes these bills, it will only continue the assault on freedom in the so-called free state of Florida. 

Overall, the analogy to how **"Florida developers are famous for naming subdivisions after the wildlife they chased away (”Turtle Run,” “Heron Pointe”)."** is apt. For all his talk of freedom, DeSantis is after state control of as much as he can get his hands on.
