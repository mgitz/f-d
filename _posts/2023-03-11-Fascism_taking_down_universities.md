[HB 999](https://www.myfloridahouse.gov/Sections/Documents/loaddoc.aspx?PublicationType=Committees&CommitteeId=3247&Session=2023&DocumentType=Proposed%20Committee%20Substitutes%20(PCSs)&FileName=PCS%20for%20HB%20999.pdf) is working its way through the heavily Republican controlled Florida legislature. Again, the small government Republicans want to limit speech on college campuses and impose their wishes.

They really want to burn down the great universities in the state of Florida!

First they would eliminate majors/minors:

> The board shall periodically review the mission of each constituent university and provide updates or revisions to such mission, as appropriate; upon completion of such review, examine existing academic programs at each constituent university for alignment with the university's mission; and provide direction to each constituent university to **remove from its programs any major or minor that is based on or otherwise utilizes pedagogical methodology associated with Critical Theory, including, but not limited to, Critical Race Theory, Critical Race Studies, Critical Ethnic Studies, Radical Feminist Theory, Radical Gender Theory, Queer Theory, Critical Social Justice, or Intersectionality, as defined in Board of Governors regulation, or any major or minor that includes a curriculum that promotes the concepts listed in s. 1000.05(4)(a)**.

Hmm...maybe if students didn't want to take these majors/minors, they would go away on their own..."Free market!!" but not when the GOP doesn't like the outcome...

They also make the appointed Board of Trustees responsible for hiring faculty:

> Each state university board of trustees is responsible for hiring full-time faculty for the university.

How are the Board of Trustees going to identify the best candidates for each faculty hire in all the different departments? Likely answer...they will only overrule the department's choices when there's a politically movitated reson to do so...
